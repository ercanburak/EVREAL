# EVREAL (Event-based Video Reconstruction Evaluation and Analysis Library)

This is the official repository for the [CVPRW 2023](https://tub-rip.github.io/eventvision2023/) paper **[EVREAL: Towards a Comprehensive Benchmark and Analysis Suite for Event-based Video Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00434)** by [Burak Ercan](https://ercanburak.github.io/), [Onur Eker](https://github.com/ekeronur/), [Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/), and [Erkut Erdem](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~erkut/).

In this work we present **EVREAL**, an open-source framework that offers a unified evaluation pipeline to comprehensively benchmark PyTorch based **pre-trained neural networks** for **event-based video reconstruction**, and a result analysis tool to **visualize and compare** reconstructions and their scores.
